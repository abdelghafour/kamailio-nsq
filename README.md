Here is how I would structure the documentation for this module:

NSQ Module

1. Overview
NSQ is a realtime distributed messaging platform designed to operate at scale, handling billions of messages per day.
It promotes distributed and decentralized topologies without single points of failure, enabling fault tolerance and high availability coupled with a reliable message delivery guarantee.

From a high-level, the purpose of the module might be for things like:
* Integrate to an application to make real-time routing decisions (instead of using, say, a SQL database)
Provide a real-time integration into your program, instead of your database, so you can overlay additional logic in your preferred language while also utilizing a message bus
Utilize messaging to have a distributed messaging layer, such that machines processing requests/responses/events can go up/down or share the workload and your Kamailio node will still be happy
supported operations are:
publish json payloads to nsq topics
publish json payloads to nsq topics and wait for correlated response message
subscribe to an nsq topic and channel and handle events from that channel
The NSQ module also has support to publish updates to presence module thru the nsq_pua_publish function

2. How it works
The module works with a main forked process that does the communication with your nsq system for issuing publishes, waiting for replies, and consuming messages. When it consumes a message it defers the process to a worker thread so it doesn't block the main process (uses libev).
